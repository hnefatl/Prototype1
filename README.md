Room Booking System - A2 Computing Project

Designed to allow users in a school to view and book rooms around site, with highly customisable features.

Client and Server are the executable projects - NetCore and Data provide shared networking and database capabilities, while Shared provides structures that are common to both the networking AND database projects.

The project writeup along with numerous files used during the writeup can be found in the _Writeup folder.

The WebService project is non-functional. It was an experiment with porting the code to a web-interface (ASP.NET MVC3) that was never completed - the desktop version was better suited to my development skills.
